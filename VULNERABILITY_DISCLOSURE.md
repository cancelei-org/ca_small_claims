# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We take the security of our users' data seriously. If you find a security vulnerability in this project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, send an email to security@example.com (placeholder) with the following information:

*   A description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the issue.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

## Policy

*   Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before making any information public.
*   Do not exploit the vulnerability further than necessary to prove its existence.
*   Do not access or modify user data without permission.
*   Do not perform denial-of-service attacks.

## Rewards

As an open-source project, we do not currently offer a formal bug bounty program, but we will publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired) once the issue is resolved.

Thank you for helping keep California Small Claims Court Forms secure!
